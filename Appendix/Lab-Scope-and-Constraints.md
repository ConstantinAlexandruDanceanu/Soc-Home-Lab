# Appendix – Lab Scope and Constraints

This appendix defines the scope and limitations of this lab
to clarify what is intentionally included and excluded.

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate SOC analyst thinking,
not to simulate a full enterprise environment.

---

## Scope

This lab focuses on:
- Log analysis and alert review in Wazuh
- Identification of patterns across multiple alerts
- Triage and initial incident classification
- Decision-making for benign vs suspicious vs malicious activity
- Escalation logic from a SOC perspective

The emphasis is on analysis and reasoning based on telemetry,
not on attack execution or remediation.

---

## Constraints

This lab is intentionally limited by the following constraints:
- Single endpoint environment
- No lateral movement or multi-host correlation
- No enterprise identity infrastructure (AD, IAM)
- Limited network complexity
- No full incident response or disaster recovery actions

These constraints reflect a simplified environment
suitable for learning and demonstration purposes.

---

## Out of Scope

The following areas are explicitly out of scope for this lab:
- Malware eradication
- Forensic acquisition or disk analysis
- System rebuild or recovery
- Incident response execution
- Disaster recovery planning

These activities would typically be handled by
dedicated IR or infrastructure teams.

---

## Final Note

This lab is designed as a first SOC-focused project.
The scope and constraints are intentional to ensure
clarity, ownership, and realistic expectations.
