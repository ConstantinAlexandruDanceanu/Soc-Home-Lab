Architecture Overview

This lab uses a simple SOC-style architecture focused on visibility and analysis.

Components:
- Windows 11 endpoint monitored with Sysmon
- Wazuh Server used as SIEM for log collection and visualization
- Kali Linux VM used to simulate external activity

Purpose:
The architecture represents a simplified but realistic setup where
external activity targeting an endpoint can be observed and analyzed
from a SOC Analyst Tier 1 perspective.
