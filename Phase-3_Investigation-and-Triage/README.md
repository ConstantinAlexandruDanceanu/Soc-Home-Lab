# Phase 3 – Investigation and Triage

## Goal
The goal of this phase is to take alerts already observed in Phase 2 and analyze them
from a SOC Analyst Tier 1 perspective.

The focus is on understanding what the alert means, validating context,
and deciding whether escalation is required.

## What This Phase Covers
In this phase, I work only with existing alerts and logs.
No new activity is generated.

The main objectives are:
- reviewing alerts in detail
- correlating related events
- understanding timelines
- making a clear analyst decision

This phase reflects the day-to-day work of a SOC Tier 1 analyst handling incoming alerts.

## How Investigations Are Approached
Each investigation starts from a real alert observed in Phase 2.
For each case, I look at:
- what triggered the alert
- who initiated the activity
- whether there is follow-up behavior
- whether the activity fits a benign or suspicious pattern

The outcome of each investigation is a documented verdict.

## Scope
The focus is on:
- process activity
- authentication failures
- basic network-related alerts

Advanced incident response, threat hunting, and malware analysis are intentionally
not covered at this stage.

## Status
Work in progress.

## Notes
This phase emphasizes analyst judgment and decision-making.
The goal is not to find threats at all costs, but to understand alerts
and decide when escalation is justified.
