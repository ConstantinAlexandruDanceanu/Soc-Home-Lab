## Scenario 5 – File Impact

### Objective
Observe file creation activity initiated by PowerShell and its detection by the SIEM.

### Environment
- Windows 11 endpoint
- Sysmon enabled
- Wazuh SIEM

### Activity
A PowerShell command was executed to create a file inside the user Temp directory.

Command executed:
New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\lab_file_impact.txt -ItemType File

### Detection
The SIEM detected a file creation event generated by PowerShell.

- Event ID: Sysmon Event ID 11 (File Create)
- Process: powershell.exe
- File created: lab_file_impact.txt
- Path: C:\Users\dance\AppData\Local\Temp
- User: Alex-D\dance
- Alert level: Medium

### Analysis
File creation in temporary directories is a common technique used by malware and scripts during execution and staging phases.
While this activity is legitimate in this context, similar behavior is frequently associated with malicious payload deployment.

### Conclusion
The alert was classified as benign but relevant.
File creation events should be correlated with process execution, parent-child relationships, and subsequent actions to determine intent.
