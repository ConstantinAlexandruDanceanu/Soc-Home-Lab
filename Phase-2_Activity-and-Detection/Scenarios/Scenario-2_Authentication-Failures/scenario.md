# Scenario 2 – Failed Authentication (Local)

## Objective
Observe and analyze a failed local authentication attempt generated by an interactive user and how it is detected by the SIEM.

## Environment
- Windows 11 endpoint (real system)
- Wazuh SIEM
- Windows Security logs collected
- Sysmon enabled (not primary for this scenario)

## Planned Activity
Generate a failed authentication attempt using the `runas` command with invalid credentials in order to trigger a Windows Security failed logon event.

## Activity Performed
From an interactive user session, the following command was executed: "runas /user:testuser cmd"

An incorrect password was intentionally provided.

Due to the behavior of the `runas` utility, the command prompt closes immediately after a failed authentication attempt and no visible error message is displayed on the endpoint.

## Expected Outcome
- Windows Security Event ID 4625 generated
- Failed authentication alert visible in Wazuh
- Logon type and failure details available for analysis

## Detection
The Wazuh SIEM detected a failed authentication attempt on endpoint **ALEXD** through Windows Security event logs.

## Alert Details
- Event ID: 4625  
- Target user: `testuser`  
- Initiating user: `Alex-D\dance`  
- Logon type: 2 (Interactive)  
- Authentication package: Negotiate  
- Process involved: `svchost.exe`  
- Result: Logon failure  

## Analysis
This activity represents a failed interactive authentication attempt.

While the command was executed for testing purposes, similar behavior is commonly associated with user error, misconfiguration, or early-stage credential access attempts.

No repeated failures, privilege escalation, or lateral movement were observed.

## Limitations
The `runas` utility does not display a visible error message after a failed authentication attempt, as the process terminates immediately.

As a result, confirmation of the failed authentication relies entirely on log analysis rather than endpoint output.

## Analyst Decision
The activity was classified as **benign but security-relevant**.

No escalation was required. The endpoint should remain under monitoring for repeated failures or correlated suspicious behavior.
