## Scenario 4 – Parent / Child Process Execution

### Objective
Observe and analyze a parent-child process relationship where a command shell spawns a secondary process, a common technique used during execution and scripting activity.

### Environment
- Windows 11 endpoint (real system)
- Sysmon enabled
- Wazuh SIEM

### Planned Activity
A Command Prompt session launches PowerShell to execute a simple command.

### Command Executed
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "Get-Date"

### Detection
Wazuh detected a process creation event generated by Sysmon (Event ID 1).  
The event shows `cmd.exe` as the parent process and `powershell.exe` as the child process.

### Alert Details
- Parent process: `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`
- Child process: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
- User: Alex-D\dance
- Execution context: Interactive user session
- Detection source: Sysmon Process Create (Event ID 1)

### Analysis
This behavior is commonly observed in both legitimate administrative activity and attacker execution chains.  
Attackers frequently use parent-child process relationships to blend into normal system behavior or execute follow-on commands.

In this case, the activity was benign and initiated by the local user for testing purposes.

### Conclusion
The event was classified as informational but relevant.  
Parent-child process relationships should be monitored and correlated with command content and subsequent activity to determine intent.
